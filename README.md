The aim of this project is to build a machine learning classification model using the scikit-learn library to predict outcomes from a structured dataset. Specifically, we use the famous Iris flower dataset, which is a multiclass classification problem involving three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model’s goal is to predict the species of a flower based on four key features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project was executed using Python in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). To facilitate an interactive and well-documented implementation, the model was built inside a Jupyter Notebook with clearly divided cells for each step. This allowed easy testing, debugging, visualization, and documentation of results.

The first step involved setting up the development environment. We installed Python and essential libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. The Jupyter and Python extensions were also installed in VS Code to support notebook execution.

Next, the Iris dataset was loaded using the built-in load_iris() function from sklearn.datasets. This dataset was then converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier analysis and manipulation. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the structure of the dataset. Using df.head() and df.describe(), we inspected the features and distributions. Additionally, a pairplot using Seaborn was generated to visualize feature relationships and class separations.

The dataset was then split into two parts: features (X) and labels (y), where X contained the four measurement features, and y represented the target species label. We used the train_test_split() function to divide the dataset into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio to evaluate the model fairly.

For the machine learning model, we chose the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method known for its robustness and accuracy. It combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting. The model was trained using the training set, and predictions were made on the unseen test data.

To evaluate the performance of the model, we used accuracy as the primary metric, along with a detailed classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. The model achieved an accuracy of over 90%, which is excellent for a basic implementation without hyperparameter tuning.

Throughout the project, best practices were followed such as modularizing the code, adding comments, and writing markdown explanations for each major step. This ensured clarity and ease of understanding, especially for beginners. The final notebook is neatly organized and can serve as a template for future classification tasks with different datasets.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates a complete pipeline of machine learning model implementation—from loading and exploring data to training and evaluating a predictive model. It reinforces essential concepts in supervised learning and showcases the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm. Moreover, it highlights the simplicity and power of Python’s scikit-learn library, making it an ideal tool for beginners entering the field of machine learning.
